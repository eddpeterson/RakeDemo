namespace :morning do
    task :turn_of_alarm
    ....
end
rake COFFEE_CUPS=5 morning:ready_for_the_day

# 7. Rake default task
task :default => 'morning:turn_off_alarm'
# now you can run simply rake on command line
rake

# 8. Add desc to use rake -T command for listing all the tasks
desc "make coffee"
task :make_coffee do
  cups = ENV["COFFEE_CUPS"] || 2
  puts "Made #{cups} cups of coffee. Shakes are gone."
end
# view from command line list of rake tasks
rake -T

# 9. Invoking tasks
namespace :afternoon do
  desc "make coffe on afternoon"
  task :make_coffee do
    Rake::Task['morning:make_coffee'].invoke
    puts "Ready for the rest of the day!"
